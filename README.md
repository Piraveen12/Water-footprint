# Water Footprint Tracker 💧

## 📌 Problem Statement

Freshwater is a limited and essential natural resource, yet its excessive and inefficient use has become a major global concern. A significant portion of freshwater is consumed indirectly through the production of everyday goods and services such as food, clothing, and household products. This hidden consumption, known as the water footprint, often goes unnoticed by individuals and communities.

In many regions, especially water-stressed areas of India, increasing pollution, over-extraction of groundwater, and climate change have resulted in severe water scarcity. The lack of awareness about the water footprint of daily-use products leads to unsustainable consumption patterns, further aggravating water stress and threatening public health, food security, and future water availability.

Although water footprint data exists in research and reports, it is not readily accessible to the general public in a simple, user-friendly, and localized manner. There is a need for a digital platform that can provide real-time or estimated water footprint information using minimal user input, support regional languages, and educate users about sustainable water usage.

This project aims to develop a user-friendly web application that leverages digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data analytics, and modern web technologies to estimate and display the water footprint of products used in daily life. The proposed system will help users make informed decisions, promote water conservation, and contribute towards sustainable resource management.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project

### Primary Objectives
*   **Calculate & Display**: Design and develop a web-based application that calculates and displays the water footprint of commonly used products and services.
*   **Create Awareness**: Create awareness among users about indirect water consumption and its environmental impact.
